1.1
#
I have forget the bug I had repaired;
probably is ??Concurrent??

1.2
#
The problem is that I have some misunderstand of the tcp;
you should receive many times to receive all datas from the sender;
not once.

#
Maybe this time I have repaired the bug of a file_open_too_much problem;
but I don't confirm it. 








Good luck.
Use happy.
